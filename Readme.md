## Inspiration
A smart city is a city which is independent on its own, which produce less pollution, less waste and less chemically harmful gases. 
but how can we reduce pollution? switch to eco-friendly cars or switch to bicycles.But why will I pay to rent them?

## What it does
first thing we can put advertisements on your bicycles which will generate us revenue. 
secondly the main idea, we will connect a dynamo to the wheels of bicycle
 what is dynamo?
dynamo is a device which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy.
when we will connect dynamo to the wheels of bicycle when the bicycle move the dynamo's shaft will rotate which will convert mechanical energy to electrical energy which can be stored to a battery at the back of cycle.
The energy stored can be used anywhere.

what we achieved by this?
0. City is turning smart as it is thinking of his own.
1. a cleaner mode of transportation which will cost nothing to the users.
2. the users will be healthy as cycling is a great exercise.
3. Less traffic on roads.
4. renewable source of energy produced.

the site provide user the facility of BUY SELL and BORROW 
you can also buy a bicycle you can also sell a bicycle and rent the bicycle for free



## How I built it
Team coordination made it possible.


## Challenges I ran into
Compiling projects was a tough job and coming up with an idea was tougher.


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are able to contribute to society, small contribution but yes we contributed for a better cause and if implemented wisely can create a difference.

## What I learned
Learned to value time and that every problem can be solved if you have stack overflow at your back.

## What's next for BuyCyBorrow
We can install the dynamo at public gyms.
Now a days gyms are installed in every park if we install dynamo to every gym machine and store the energy produced, we will be able to produce renewable source of energy which is totally pollution free.

We can also collaborate with metro cycle providing services.
